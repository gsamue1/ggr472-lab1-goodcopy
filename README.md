GGR472 Lab 1 

**Summary:**
This repository develops a two page website that embeds GIFS, a GeoJSON file (in code form) and links to external sources. Specifically, the GeoJSON file is investigating sandwich and park locations around Toronto.  

**Subject Matter:**
Sandwiches, Toronto, Parks 

**Code Sources**
- Navigation bar code was pulled from Bootstrap 
- Poll Code was developed using point and click service Opinion Stage that converted preferences to html script
  - Going forward potentially transfer JavaScript code that Opinion Stage embedded into html into a separate java page to ensure html is solely focused on 
    website structure
